      <h2>ðŸŽ­ Creative Soul</h2>
      <p>Iâ€™m a poet, writer, and storyteller. I started writing when I was in the fifth grade. I would always read books and I so desperately wanted to create my own stories. Some of my recent work includes a poem titled <em>"10 things I love about you"</em> and another one in progress called <em>"Kill the girl and become a woman" I hope you enjoy looking through my website</em> â€” </p>
